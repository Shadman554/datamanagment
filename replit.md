# Veterinary Dictionary Admin Panel

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built as an admin panel for managing a veterinary dictionary mobile app. The system provides a comprehensive interface for managing veterinary content including books, medical terms, diseases, drugs, tutorial videos, staff information, and user interactions.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight React router)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: MySQL with Drizzle ORM
- **File Storage**: Firebase Storage for images and PDFs
- **Authentication**: JWT-based admin authentication

## Key Components

### Database Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for MySQL
- **Schema Location**: `shared/schema.ts` - contains all type definitions and validation schemas
- **Migration System**: Database migrations stored in `./migrations` directory
- **Provider**: Railway MySQL Database

### Data Collections
The system manages 11 distinct data collections:
- **Books**: Veterinary textbooks and publications with PDF storage
- **Words**: Dictionary terms in English, Kurdish, and Arabic
- **Diseases**: Animal diseases with symptoms, causes, and treatments
- **Drugs**: Veterinary medications with usage and side effects
- **Tutorial Videos**: Educational YouTube videos
- **Staff**: Team member profiles with social media links
- **Questions**: User-submitted questions with likes system
- **Notifications**: Push notifications for mobile app
- **Users**: User profiles with point system
- **Normal Ranges**: Laboratory reference values for different species
- **App Links**: Download links for mobile applications

### File Management
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage for images and PDFs
- **Upload System**: Drag-and-drop file upload with progress tracking
- **File Types**: Supports images (covers, photos) and PDFs (books, documents)
- **Preview**: Image preview functionality for uploaded files

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: Frontend makes API calls through React Query
2. **Authentication**: Admin authentication middleware validates JWT tokens
3. **Authorization**: Role-based access control (super admin vs admin)
4. **API Layer**: Express.js routes handle CRUD operations
5. **Activity Logging**: All admin actions are logged to PostgreSQL database
6. **Data Validation**: Zod schemas validate incoming data
7. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM manages PostgreSQL interactions
8. **File Operations**: Firebase Storage handles file uploads/downloads
9. **Response**: JSON responses sent back to client
10. **State Updates**: React Query updates client-side cache

## Admin Authentication System

### Overview
A comprehensive admin authentication and activity tracking system has been implemented with PostgreSQL database backend and JWT-based session management.

### Features
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Super Admin and Admin roles with different permissions
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT tokens with HTTP-only cookies, bcrypt password hashing
- **Activity Tracking**: Complete audit trail of all admin actions (create, update, delete)
- **Admin Statistics**: Real-time statistics showing admin activity metrics
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic cleanup

### Database Tables
- **admin_users**: Admin account information with roles and authentication data
- **admin_sessions**: JWT session tracking with expiration and device information
- **activity_logs**: Complete audit trail of admin actions with metadata

### Access Routes
- **Admin Panel**: Access via `/admin` route
- **Super Admin Dashboard**: Full statistics and activity monitoring
- **Admin Dashboard**: Limited access for regular admins
- **Login System**: Secure authentication flow with proper error handling

### Super Admin Credentials
- **Username**: `superadmin`
- **Password**: `SuperAdmin123!`
- **Email**: `admin@vet-dict.com`
- **Role**: `super_admin`

### Activity Tracking
All admin actions are automatically logged including:
- **Action Type**: Create, Update, Delete operations
- **Collection**: Which data collection was modified
- **Document Details**: ID and title of affected items
- **Admin Information**: Who performed the action
- **Metadata**: Timestamp, IP address, user agent
- **Data Changes**: Before/after snapshots for updates and deletions

### Statistics Dashboard
Super admins can view:
- **Total Operations**: System-wide create/update/delete counts
- **Admin Performance**: Individual admin activity breakdown
- **Recent Activity**: Real-time activity feed with filtering
- **Admin Management**: User account overview and management

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **mysql2**: MySQL database connection
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database ORM
- **firebase-admin**: Server-side Firebase integration
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **@hookform/resolvers**: Form validation integration
- **zod**: Runtime type validation

### UI Dependencies
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI primitives
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework with dark mode support
- **lucide-react**: Icon library
- **react-dropzone**: File upload functionality

### Dark Mode Support
- **Theme System**: Comprehensive light/dark/system theme switching
- **Local Storage**: Theme preference persistence across sessions
- **System Detection**: Automatic theme based on user's OS preference
- **Theme Toggle**: Available in all headers and mobile sidebar
- **Full Coverage**: All components support dark mode with proper contrast

### Development Dependencies
- **vite**: Build tool and development server
- **typescript**: Type checking
- **esbuild**: Server-side bundling

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev  # Starts development server with hot reload
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build  # Builds client and server for production
npm start     # Starts production server
```

### Database Management
```bash
npm run db:push  # Push schema changes to database
```

The application is designed to be deployed on platforms that support Node.js with PostgreSQL database connectivity. The build process creates optimized bundles for both client and server code.

## Current Issues & Status

### Firebase Connection - RESOLVED ✓
**Status:** Firebase connection fully operational
**Resolution:** Service account credentials properly configured via environment variables
**Impact:** All new data now saves directly to Firebase database as intended

## Next Steps for Firebase Connection

To connect to your live Firebase database:
1. Verify Firebase private key format in your Firebase Console
2. Regenerate service account key if needed
3. Test connection will be re-enabled automatically when credentials work
4. Data can be migrated from fallback to Firebase once connected
